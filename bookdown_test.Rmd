# Introduction

This example book will show how to use bookdown to put together digital books. We are going to use some of the work we did pm the Palmer Penguins dataset for this project. 
Chapter \@ref(penguins) is about making some exploratory plots

# Palmer Penguins {#penguins}

Today we are going to work with the Palmer Penguins dataset from the `palmerpenginus`package. Install the package as follows:

```{r install, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

We are writing this in R Markdown beause you can do all sorts of things in R Markdown, such as embedding code in text: 2 + 2 = `r 2+2`

```{r load, echo = F, message = F}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The dataset

Lets take a look at the dataset available in the `palmerpenguins` package:

```{r data, eval = F, echo = F}
data(package = "palmerpenguins")
```

```{r penguins, eval = T, echo = TRUE}
head(penguins)
```

### Penguin measurments

The table `penguins` includes the following measurments:

* Bill length;
* Bill depth;
* Flipper length;
* Body mass.

#### Relationship between flipper length and bill length by species

We are going to make a plot showing how flipper length and bill length vary in different species of penguin:

```{r, echo = F, warning = F, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "My plot"}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, color = species)) + geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)", color  = "Species")
```

```{r logo, echo = F, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Logo of the palmerpenguins R package", out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("logo.png")
```
