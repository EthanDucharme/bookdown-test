We are going to use some of the work we did pm the Palmer Penguins dataset for this project. Chapter 2 is about making some exploratory plots "],["penguins.html", "Chapter 2 Palmer Penguins 2.1 The dataset", " Chapter 2 Palmer Penguins Today we are going to work with the Palmer Penguins dataset from the palmerpenginuspackage. Install the package as follows: install.packages(&quot;palmerpenguins&quot;) We are writing this in R Markdown beause you can do all sorts of things in R Markdown, such as embedding code in text: 2 + 2 = 4 2.1 The dataset Lets take a look at the dataset available in the palmerpenguins package: head(penguins) ## # A tibble: 6 x 8 ## species island bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_~ body_mass_g sex ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 Adelie Torge~ 39.1 18.7 181 3750 male ## 2 Adelie Torge~ 39.5 17.4 186 3800 fema~ ## 3 Adelie Torge~ 40.3 18 195 3250 fema~ ## 4 Adelie Torge~ NA NA NA NA &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 Adelie Torge~ 36.7 19.3 193 3450 fema~ ## 6 Adelie Torge~ 39.3 20.6 190 3650 male ## # ... with 1 more variable: year &lt;int&gt; Capturing and measuring penguins was a lot of fun 2.1.1 Penguin measurments The table penguins includes the following measurments: Bill length; Bill depth; Flipper length; Body mass. 2.1.1.1 Relationship between flipper length and bill length by species We are going to make a plot showing how flipper length and bill length vary in different species of penguin: Figure 2.1: My plot For more information about the palmerpenguins package, visit their website.
